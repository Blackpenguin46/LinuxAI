## 🧪 Testing Your LinuxAI Distribution

### Option 1: Complete Virtual Machine Setup
```bash
# Install Homebrew first (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install QEMU for virtualization
brew install qemu

# Set up VM testing environment
cd /Users/samoakes/Desktop/LinuxAI/distro-dev
make setup-vm

# Once the toolchain build completes, test in VM
make test-vm
```

### Option 2: Quick Demo with Easy Installer
```bash
cd /Users/samoakes/Desktop/LinuxAI/distro-dev
./tools/user-setup/easy-install.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual VM Testing
```bash
# After setting up VM environment
cd /Users/samoakes/Desktop/LinuxAI/distro-dev/vm-testing
./vm-manager.sh start
```
